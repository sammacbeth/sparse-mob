# Sparse[Mob]

A minimal [matrix](https://matrix.org/), and [Riot](https://about.riot.im/)-like chat web client, optimised for mobile.

## Quickstart

The project is a [react](https://reactjs.org/) app, which uses the [Matrix JS SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk) in order to sync with a Matrix homeserver.

You can start hacking on it as follows:
```bash
# checkout source
git clone https://github.com/sammacbeth/sparse-mob.git
cd sparse-mob
# fetch dependencies
yarn
# start dev server
yarn start
```
